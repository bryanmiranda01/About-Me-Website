		<i>Current Studies</i>
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in computer science. If all goes according to plan, I'll be graduating this coming fall semester. I am currently taking Calculus II, Web Technologies, Principles of Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture. I have not declared or have any plans to declare a minor in anything, but I am in the progress of declaring my concentration in Software Engineering and hope to obtain one in Cybersecurity as well.</p>

		<i>Hobbies/Interests</i>
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>My hobbies include reading, playing video games, and working out. I usually read non-fiction books more than fiction ones. I am currently reading a series called 86 Eighty-Six. In my free time I also enjoy playing video games. This month has many game releases that I have been anticipating such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. As of last year I began going to the gym and over time it has become less of a chore and much more enjoyable for me </p>
		</li>

	<h2>
		<i>Dream Job</i>
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>My dream job would be a career in mobile app development. From the different courses and projects I have had experience with so far, that is the sector of software development that I have enjoyed learning the most about. I don't have a specific company in mind that I want to work for.</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>Ideally, the job opportunity would be located somewhere close to where my family is. Most of my extended family is out of state, so I would like to remain close to my immediate family members.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<i>Favorite Movies</i>
	</h2>
		<p>I have never been a big fan of watching movies but some of my favorites include The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Spiderman Across The Spiderverse.
			<ol>
			<li>
				My favorite movie out of the trilogy would be The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers. All of the movies were very enjoyable in their own ways.</li>
			
			<li>
				Both Into and Across the Spiderverse were visually stunning movies, but picking in between the two I prefer Across the Spiderverse. Combining the visuals with an amazing soundtrack and story puts this series amongst my favorites.</li>
		</ol>
