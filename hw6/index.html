			<p>At the moment, I am concentrating in software engineering so ideally that is the sector of CS where I would like to work. I don't have much preference as to where I work other than I'd like to remain Texas. Especially in the current job market, I can't afford to be selective about which opportunities I can take. However, I do have several preferences as to what I'd prefer to work in, but nothing is set in stone.</p>

			<p>My hobbies include reading, playing video games, and working out. I usually read non-fiction books more than fiction ones. I am currently reading a series called 86 Eighty-Six. In my free time I also enjoy playing video games. This month has many game releases that I have been anticipating such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. As of last year, I also began going to the gym regularly. Over time, I have come to enjoy going rather than dreading it. </p>
