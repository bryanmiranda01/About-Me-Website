			<p>At the moment, I am concentrating in software engineering so ideally that is where I would like to work. I don't have much preference as to where other than I'd like to remain Texas. Especially in the current job market, I can't afford to be extremely selective about which opportunities I can take. However, i do have several preferences as to what I'd prefer to work in, but nothing set in stone</p>
