			<p>My hobbies include reading, playing video games, and working out. I usually read non-fiction books more than fiction ones. I am currently reading a series called 86 Eighty-Six. In my free time I also enjoy playing video games. This month has many game releases that I have been anticipating such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. As of last year I began going to the gym and over time it has become less of a chore and much more enjoyable for me </p>
