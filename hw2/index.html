		<i>Current Studies</i>
	</h2>
		<p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in computer science. If all goes according to plan, I'll be graduating this coming fall semester. I am currently taking Calculus II, Web Technologies, Principles of Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture. I have not declared or have any plans to declare a minor in anything, but I am in the progress of declaring my concentration in Software Engineering and hope to obtain one in Cybersecurity as well.</p>

		<i>Hobbies/Interests</i>
	</h2>
		<p>My hobbies include reading, playing video games, and working out. I usually read non-fiction books more than fiction ones. I am currently reading a series called 86 Eighty-Six. In my free time I also enjoy playing video games. This month has many game releases that I have been anticipating such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. As of last year I began going to the gym and over time it has become less of a chore and much more enjoyable for me.</p>

		<i>Dream Job</i>
	</h2>
		<p>My dream job would be a career in mobile app development. From the different courses and projects I have had experience with so far, that is the sector of software development that I have enjoyed learning the most about. I don't have a specific company in mind that I want to work for. Ideally, the job opportunity would be located somewhere close to where my family is. Most of my extended family is out of state, so I would like to remain close to my immediate family members.</p>

	<h2>
		<i>Favorite Movies</i>
	</h2>
		<p>I have never been a big fan of watching movies but some of my favorites include The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Spiderman Across The Spiderverse. My favorite movie out of the trilogy would be The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers. All of the movies were very enjoyable in their own ways. Both Into and Across the Spiderverse were visually stunning movies, but picking in between the two I prefer Across the Spiderverse. Combining the visuals with an amazing soundtrack and story puts this series amongst my favorites.</p>
